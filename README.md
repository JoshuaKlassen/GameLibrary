# GameLibrary README

This is a project I have been working on in my spare time.
The aim of this project is to create a 2D game engine in Java, with different areas of functionality that are optional.
If you feel like you have a different approach to an area, like networking, you can use your own code and ignore mine, and the base of the engine will still work.

Things I want to acomplish:
Networking (TCP & UDP)
Level Builder
Scripting of actors
Particles
Triggers
Save states
Path Finding
Inventory
Combinational key inputs
Camera, screenshots
Hit testing for polygons
Custom UI components

As I learn more, and have free time, I will add more.
